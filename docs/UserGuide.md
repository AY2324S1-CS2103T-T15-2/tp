# BayMeds v.2103 User Guide

## Welcome to the BayMeds User Guide!

This guide provides step-by-step documentation on BayMeds' features and commonly encountered errors. In addition, the [quick start guide](#quick-start) shows you how to get started in a matter of minutes!

### What is BayMeds?

BayMeds v.2103 (a.k.a BayMeds) is your go-to prescription management solution, catering to chronically ill patients or caregivers seeking a streamlined and effective way to track prescriptions. Ideal for those with busy lives and complex medication regimens, BayMeds offer reminders for staying on top of prescription schedules and provides a platform to track prescription consumptions. With a focus on user-friendliness, BayMeds aims to promote medication adherence and reduce misusage.

### What can I do with BayMeds?

#### Track consumption of existing prescriptions

BayMeds filters and shows you your prescriptions to be consumed each day. By marking prescriptions you have consumed, BayMeds will differentiate and show you the prescriptions that are completed and those that have yet to be completed for the day.

#### Store important details of existing prescriptions

BayMeds allows you to store details crucial to the consumption of the prescription, such as the end and expiry date of the prescription, as well as the current stock of pills available. You may also store specific requirements that a prescription may have, such as restricted consumption to only after heavy meals.

#### Get reminders on prescriptions to be consumed

BayMeds reminds you to consume your prescriptions for the day on a regular interval, to promote medication adherence.

#### Track past prescriptions

BayMeds enables storage of past prescriptions, i.e. prescriptions that you have completed in the past. This provides ease of access to such information when required, such as during a Doctor's visit, or when checking how many pills of a particular prescription I took in the past I have left.
