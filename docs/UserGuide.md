# BayMeds v.2103 User Guide

BayMeds v.2103, (a.k.a BayMeds), is a **desktop application for managing your medications**. While it has a GUI (Graphical User Interface), most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface). If you like to type fast, BayMeds can get your medication management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `BayMeds.jar` from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases). [coming soon]

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for BayMeds.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar BayMeds.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type commands in the command box and press Enter to execute it. <br> e.g. typing the command **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>

   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all prescriptions.

   * `add --medication "Doxazosin" --frequency "daily"` : Adds a prescription `Aspirin` to the list of medications.

   * `delete "Aspirin"` : Deletes the `Aspirin` prescription from the current list of medications.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `<>` are the parameters to be supplied by the user, and should begin and end with double quotation marks " ".<br>
  e.g. in `add --medication <medication_name>`, `<medication_name>` is a parameter which can be used as `add --medication "Aspirin"`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `--frequency <frequency> [--start <start_date>]` can be used as `--frequency "daily" --start "20-9-2023"` or as `--frequency "daily"`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `--medication <medication_name> --frequency <frequency>`, `--frequency <frequency> --medication <medication_name>` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Viewing help : `help` [coming soon]

_Details coming soon ..._

### Adding a prescription : `add`

Adds a prescription to the list of medications.

Format: 
```
add 
  --medication <medication_name>
  --frequency <frequency> 
  [--start <start_date>]
  [--end <end_date>]
  [--remarks <remarks>] 
```

* `<frequency>` should follow this format `<repetition dosage>`.
  * e.g. `--frequency "daily 2"`.
    * This means take 2 tabs everyday.
  * e.g. `--frequency "daily 4"`.
    * This means take 4 tabs everyday.
  * e.g. `--frequency "weekly 2"`. 
    * This means take 2 tabs on a particular day every week. The day is determined by the `<start_date>` input. If `<start_date>` is a Wednesday, this means take 2 tabs every Wednesday.
* If your prescriptions are to be taken every Wednesday and Sunday, add 2 separate entries into the list of medications.
  * `Add --medication "Accutane 1" --frequency "weekly 1" --start "27-09-2023"`.
  * `Add --medication "Accutane 2" --frequency "weekly 1" --start "01-10-2023"`.
* `<start_date>` and `<end_date>` should be in dd-mm-yyyy format.   
  * e.g. "20-09-2023".
* Since `--start <start_date>` is an optional input, if there is none given, the input date of the entry will be used as the default start date.
* Remarks can consist of any text.
  * e.g. "To be taken after meals".
  * e.g. "Take after food".

Examples:
* `add --medication "Aspirin" --frequency "daily" --start "20-09-2023" --end "03-10-2024" --remarks "Take during meals"`.
* `add --medication "Amoxicillin" --frequency "twice daily" --start "20-09-2023" --end "03-10-2024"`.
* `add --medication "Doxazosin" --frequency "daily"`.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous BayMeds home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
